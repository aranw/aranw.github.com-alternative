# JoshuaRJones.me Resume Layout

JoshuaRJones.me strives to be a clean, semantic and responsive resume-like site layout. Largely inspired from [Bold - CV / Resume Template](http://themeforest.net/item/bold-cv-resume-template-minimal-smart/210069?ref=QBKL) by [Nathan McMillan](http://nathanmcmillan.com).

I desired a responsive resume layout without extra `div`s with a class of `.clear` to make the layout work. It's a slow work in progress, mostly because I'm busy with numerous other projects, but it should be a solid semantic resume layout when it's completed.

## Skillset Region

The progress bars in the skillset region are inspired from [Chris Coyier's](http://css-tricks.com/) progress bars article, updated and cleaned up a bit.

The `span` element inside the `div` with the class `.meter` has an inline style attribute to declare the width in a percentage. This spans out the bar inside of the `div`, giving the appearance of a progress bar.
